# Secret Ballots

secret from:

* other voters
* candidates
* *system admins of the voting system*

... time for cryptography!

# Secret But Public

By encrypting connections between voters and ballots we can have public or semi-public systems with secret ballots

```
id        | 60
ballot_id | \x3132302dca9588dd ...

election_id | 1
rank        | 1
candidate   | elekto
voter       | 702a87f5-243a-49d0-8bcb-147d7a5b9ef9

#### What Is A Preference Election?

---

# "Regular" elections

1. Everyone votes for a candidate
2. Top vote-getter(s) win

Called "plurality" or "first-past-the-post"

---

# The problem with plurality

*An extreme candidate with a dedicated minority of followers often wins over a generally liked candidate*

---

# What's a preference election?

1. Vote which candidate you'd *prefer* to each other candidate
2. The most *generally acceptable* candidate(s) wins
