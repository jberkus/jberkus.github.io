Talk on how to use EXPLAIN, given at Postgres Open 2015.

Written in Remark.js.  This presentation requires a local webserver to view; 
I suggest running:

     python -m SimpleHTTPServer
     
... in the directory of the talk.

Yes, I know the CSS is terrible.  I'm not a web developer.  Pull requests welcome.
